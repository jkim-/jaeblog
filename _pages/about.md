My name is Jae, and I'm currently a PhD candidate at [Caltech](https://caltech.edu) studying experimental particle physics while minoring in computer science.

My primary interests are data analysis and inference.  I enjoy working with challenging real-world datasets that are not as 'nice' as the standard datatsets used in many ML research settings.

In the past, I have worked with:

* Data from the [BaBar detector](https://www.slac.stanford.edu/BFROOT/www/doc/workbook/detector/detector.html).

* Player movement time-series data from NBA games extracted using computer vision ([2S](https://www.secondspectrum.com)).

I plan to graduate some time during the winter of 2018, and currently searching for full-time positions!
